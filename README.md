# DSA in C++ (Striver A-Z)
A repository containing all the detailed concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ 

----

## Step 1: Learn the Basics 
### Imput/Output in C++
A short and simple summary of C++ I/O for beginners – inspired by takeUforward.


#### ✅ 1. Include Libraries
Start your code by adding:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
```
This lets you use cin and cout for input and output.

#### ✅ 2. Basic Program Structure
```cpp
#include<iostream>
int main() {
    // your code here
    return 0;
}
```

#### ✅ 3. Printing Output
Use cout to print:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hey, Striver!";
    return 0;
}
```
✅ Use \n or std::endl to print on a new line:
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello\nWorld";
```
